# Code editor component for PyQt and Pyside

[API documentation](https://qutepart.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

The component is based on [kate syntax files](http://kate-editor.org/2005/03/24/writing-a-syntax-highlighting-file/)
Kate and katepart is really cool software, but it depend on huge KDE libraries. Goal of this project is making a code editor component, which don't have so lot of dependencies
