# Code editor component for PyQt and Pyside

Based on [kate syntax files](http://kate-editor.org/2005/03/24/writing-a-syntax-highlighting-file/)

Kate and katepart is really cool software. It is sad, that it depends on KDE and contains C++ code.

qutepart will

* Depend only on PyQt (or Pyside)
* Be easily portable, because will contain only Python code (no C++)
